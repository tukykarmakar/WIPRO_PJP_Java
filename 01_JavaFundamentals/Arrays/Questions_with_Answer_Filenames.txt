1. Write a program to initialize an integer array and print the sum and average of the array.
Assignment1.java

2. Write a program to initialize an integer array and find the maximum and minimum value of the array.
Assignment2.java

3. Write a program to initialize an integer array with values and check if a given number is present in the array or not.

If the number is not found, it will print -1 else it will print the index value of the given  number in the array.

Example 1) If the Array elements are  {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 90, then the output expected is -1.

Example 2)If the Array elements are  {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 56, then the output expected is 3.

4. Initialize an integer array with ascii values and print the corresponding character values in a single row.
Assignment4.java

5. Write a program to find the largest 2 numbers and the smallest 2 numbers in the given array.
Assignment5.java

6. Write a program to initialize an array and print them in a sorted order.
Assignment6.java

7. Write a program to remove the duplicate elements in an array and print the same.
Example)
I/P:{12,34,12,45,67,89}
O/P:{12,34,45,67,89}
Assignment7.java

8. Write a program to print the sum of the elements of an array following the given below condition.

If the array has 6 and 7 in succeeding orders, ignore the numbers between 6 and 7 and consider the other numbers for calculation of sum.

Eg1) Array Elements - 10,3,6,1,2,7,9
O/P: 22   
[i.e 10+3+9]

Eg2) Array Elements - 7,1,2,3,6
O/P:19

Eg3) Array Elements - 1,6,4,7,9
O/P:10
Assignment8.java

9. Write a program to reverse the elements of a given 2*2 array. Four integer numbers needs to be passed as Command Line arguments.

Example1)
C:\>java Sample 1 2 3
O/P: Please enter 4 integer numbers

Example2)
C:\>java Sample 1 2 3 4
O/P: 
 The given array is :
  1 2 
  3 4 
 The reverse of the array is :
  4 3 
  2 1
Assignment9.java

10. Write a program to find the biggest number in a 3*3 array. The program is supposed to receive 9 integer numbers as command line arguments.

Example1:
C:\>java Sample 1 2 3
O/P: Please enter 9 integer numbers

Example2:
C:\>java Sample 1 23 45 55 121 222 56 77 89
O/P: 
The given array is :
1 23 45 
55 121 222 
56 77 89 
The biggest number in the given array is 222
