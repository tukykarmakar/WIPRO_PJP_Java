1. Write a Program to check whether a given String is Palindrome or not.
Assignment1.java

2. Write a java program that will concatenate 2 strings and return the result. The result should be in lowercase.

Note:If the concatenation creates a double-char, then one of the characters need to be omitted.

Example1)
i/p:Sachin,Tendulkar
o/p:sachin tendulkar

Example2)
i/p:Mark,kate
o/p:markate
Assignment2.java

3. Given a string, return a new string made of 'n' copies of the first 2 chars of the original string where 'n' is the length of the string.

Example1)
i/p:Wipro
o/p:WiWiWiWiWi
Assignment3.java

4. Write a java program that will return the first half of the string, if the length of the string is even. It should return null for odd length string.

Example1)
i/p:TomCat
o/p:Tom

Example2)
i/p:Apron
o/p:null
Assignment4.java

5. Write a java program that accepts a string and returns a new string without the first and last character of the input string.

Example1)
i/p:Suman
o/p:uma
Assignment5.java

6. Given 2 strings, a and b, return a new string of the form short+long+short, with the shorter string on the outside and the longer string on the inside.

The strings will not be the same length, but they may be empty (length 0).

If input is "hi" and "hello", then output will be "hihellohi".
Assignment6.java

7. Given a string, if the first or last chars are 'x', return the string without those 'x' chars, otherwise return the string unchanged. 

If the input is "xHix", then output is "Hi".
If the input is "America", then the output is "America".
Assignment7.java

8. Write a Java program that accepts a string (with * in it). The program should return a new string in which the following characters are removed-*,the characters that are to the left and right of *

Example1)
i/p:ab*cd
o/p:ad
Assignment8.java

9. Given two strings, a and b, print a new string which is made of the following combination-first character of a, the first character of b, second character of a, second character of b and so on. 
Any characters left, will go to the end of the result.

Example1)
i/p:Hello,World
o/p:HWeolrllod
Assignment9.java

10. Given a string and an integer n, print a new string made of n repetitions of the last n characters of the string. 
You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the string, inclusive. 

Example1)
i/p:Wipro,3
o/p:propropro
Assignment10.java

11. Given two strings a and b, return a new string, following the rules given below. 
If string b occurs in string a, then the new string should concatenate the characters that appear before and after of String b.
Ignore cases where there is no character before or after the word, and a character may be included twice if it is in between two string b's.

Example1)
i/p:abcXY123XYijk,XY
o/p:c13i

Example2)
i/p:XY123XY,XY
o/p:13

Example3)
i/p:XY1XY,XY
o/p:11
